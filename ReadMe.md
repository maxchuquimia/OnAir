# On Air
**_A macOS app that helps other people at home know when you're in a meeting._**

_On Air_ runs in your status bar. It subtly turns from üü¢ green to üî¥ red when another nearby _On Air_ user's microphone is in use.

## How it works

_On Air_ periodically takes a screenshot of your status bar to check for the presence of the orange üü† ‚ÄúSensor&nbsp;Indicator‚Äù icon:

If the orange dot is there, your microphone is in use (even if it's muted) - indicating that you are in a meeting. _On Air_ then updates the _On Air_ icon on nearby Macs to show that you are in a meeting.

## Installation
Download a notarized version of `OnAir.app` from [the releases page](https://github.com/maxchuquimia/OnAir/releases). 
Or, compile it yourself from this repo's source code.

## Privacy
_On Air_ only connects to nearby devices locally - your information is never sent to any third party server (including our own).

## Caveats
- Most likely only works if English is set as the system language (see `WindowInfoRecognizer`)
- Future versions of macOS could change how the Status Indicator dot works, resulting in _On Air_ breaking
- No unit tests at this time :(
- UI state is represented as an injected singleton as I still haven't found a nice way to bind SwiftUI to a traditional view model yet. At least the core logic is entirely separated from the view this way... it works for a single-view-model app like this.
